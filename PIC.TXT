ok iam being to think a new picture file format is going to be a good ider
because i have been programing in euohoria for so long i have seen a lot of
programs that have sepret picture files all of or most of these are the bmp
type format and with this file format has a lot of problems one of wich is
the fact that every picture has to be save on disk by it self you have no
way of doing transpants on the picturs or anamations and you can't keep all
of your files in one file and you sently can't open that one file and edit
the pictures in a drawing program its just not been done so iam thinking
that programers would realy like a esay way to do this and i think i can
acive this so iam going to make it for the euphoria programing world.
i will have to make all of this in windows it will take to long in dos
because dos in limiting in meay ways one of wich is the fact that you can
only 256 colours.

i have made some of the drawing program in dos and think it will be so
much esay in windows because you can use the graphic user interface
that windows has builted into it self and there 24 bit colours and that is
the target platform for my drawing program and my picture file format
ther is one moor thing i would like to add to my picture file format and that
is colour blending like vector images use if i can include colour blending
and get it to work to a good stander then my file format will be use by
the euphoria programing comuituy for sure and my drawing program and maybe
the outside world to but if my file format fails then i will have to say i
didn't tell you so i think it will take off like a rocket onec it has been
noteis for what it is

my picture file format is going to be huge in the euphoria programing world
iam going to get everone wohs programs in euphoria usesing my picture format
the picture format is going to able to do colour blending this means that
if you have a picture with a width and height of 32 and you want to zoom
in on the picture you can and the picture quitly will look has good has it
did befor when you zoom in on it by the way when we zoom in on the picture the
width and height was 100 you could zoom in has much as you like without lost
of quitly the format all so able to do anamtions this means you can stroe has
many pictures in one file so long has they all have the same width and height
thers even transprants settings that can be used on your picture it has 24 bit
color and the file can be comprees so you can acvied very small file sizes
ok some of you might want to store all of your pictures into one file this
can be acvide has well its very simple you frist have to find the files you
want to be put in one file and then give the name of the file thats going
to have all the files put into and thats.

i no i can have 24 bit colours and anamtion and transpants and comprestion
but the colour blending iam not sure of i have to make it frist and well i no
i can make it but if it will work like i want it to i don't no

i still need to make a program thats going to be able to create these picture
images i have got a dos drawing program that can creat and edit this picture
format but the format has not been completed i mean that the way this format
works has not yet been desied on i realy want to make a windows drawing
program and from there work out how the file format is going to work because
there a lot of diffenc between dos and windows this will not take long once
i have windows if i can make a relay cool drawing program i will be happy
this program is going to have some way of haveing will i don't fucking no

when i was programing in windows i learn a lot and i no there is
all so a picture format that has no drawing program to go with it
the picture format that iam talking about is to do with the toolbar that
so many programs use it would be cool to make a program that can edit and
create these pictures it would be very esay to make a drawing program that
could do all of this and i might need a program like this
i could all so make a drawing program for editing windows icons
i could all so make a program that can edit all of these pictures formats
bitmaps gif icons toolbar and my very own format
